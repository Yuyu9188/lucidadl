  Schedule lucidadl to run "in the background" on Windows.

  Registers a Windows Scheduled Task that runs a watchlist (`lucida albums` or
  `lucida tracks`) every day at a given time.

  IMPORTANT: the task runs only "when the user is logged on" (Interactive logon),
  because the browser needs a visible desktop to pass Cloudflare the first time the
  cached cookie expires. Stay logged in at the scheduled time.

  Examples:
    .\schedule.ps1                                  # albums, every day at 09:00
    .\schedule.ps1 -Mode tracks -Time 21:30
    .\schedule.ps1 -Mode albums -Time 08:00 -TaskName LucidaMorning
    .\schedule.ps1 -WorkingDir "C:\Users\me\music-lists"   # folder that holds inputs\
  Remove it:  Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName LucidaDL -Confirm:$false
#>
param(
  [ValidateSet("albums", "tracks")] [string]$Mode = "albums",
  [string]$Time = "09:00",
  [string]$TaskName = "LucidaDL",
  [string]$WorkingDir = (Get-Location).Path
)

# The watchlist (`tracks`/`albums`) reads .\inputs\<mode>.txt relative to the working
# directory, so point the task at a folder that contains your inputs\ folder.
